# Neural-Network

This repository is implementation of neural network from the scratch in C++. There are two codes. The first code is a neural network without hidden layer which is called **Perceptron** and is able to predict a class type based on an input data when the classes are **only linearly separable**. In other words, it acts like linear regression.

The second file (NN_with_Hidden_Layer.cpp) is implementation of a neural network with a single hidden layer which is able to predict a class type based on an input data when the separation between the classes is not possible using a straight line and the relationship between the data is complex and nonlinear.
