# Neural-Network

This repository is implementation of neural network from the scratch in C++. There are 3 codes. The first code is a neural network without hidden layer which is called **Perceptron** and is able to predict a class type based on an input data when the classes are **only linearly separable**. In other words, it acts like linear regression.

The second file (**NN_with_Hidden_Layer.cpp**) is implementation of a neural network with a single hidden layer which is able to predict a class type based on an input data when the separation between the classes is not possible using a straight line and the relationship between the data is complex and nonlinear.

The third code is a real application of neural network for prediction of an eye disease based on input data-set (**IIH_Prediction_Neural_Network.cpp**). The data set has been saved in a text file (**EYE-DATA.txt**).
